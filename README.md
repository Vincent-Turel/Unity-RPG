# RPG game made on Unity

## Context 
This project dates back to October 2021.

It has been realized in collaboration with [Julien Withfield](https://github.com/thekidvoomer) within the scope of the course *CS412/512 - Computer Games Design*  during my exchange semester at Bishop's University, Canada.

## Software

The game has been developped and tested under Unity version **2021.3.8f1 LTS** / JetBrains Rider 2021

## Description

This is a RPG game.

You can fight enemies. They drop items dying that you can then pick up and equip in your inventory.

It is supposed to have a final boss which is a dragon at the top of the mountain. Unfortunately, I've been obliged to delete it because its model was too heavy for Github.
